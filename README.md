Zipline Incidence Response Project
Mainly using python and geopandas for now. In the future maybe Django/Zipmaps(Docker)- Need to be figured out by me.
An app that is supposed to function as follows:
 1.Gets input from a user in the form of coordinates
 2.Plots the coordinates on a map 
 3.Zoom in to the dristict 
 4.Return the nearest town/settlement 
 5.Return the attributes associated with the district/town
